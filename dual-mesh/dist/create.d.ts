/**
 * Build a dual mesh from points, with ghost triangles around the exterior.
 *
 * Options:
 *   - To have equally spaced points added around a rectangular boundary,
 *     pass in a boundary with the rectangle size and the boundary spacing.
 *     If using Poisson disc points, I recommend âˆš2 times the spacing used
 *     for Poisson disc.
 *
 * Phases:
 *   - Add boundary points
 *   - Add your own set of points
 *   - Add Poisson disc points
 *
 * The mesh generator runs some sanity checks but does not correct the
 * generated points.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Build a mesh with poisson disc points and a boundary:
 *
 * TODO:
 * new MeshBuilder(options)
 *    .appendPoints(pointsArray)
 *    .create()
